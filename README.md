Problem description:

In this project, our goal is to work with Chantal Rodier (University of Ottawa), Deborah Tihanyi (University of Toronto), and Lydia Wilkinson (University of Toronto) to design and develop a new web platform for the Canadian Engineering Education Association (CEEA), specifically for their "Humanities in Engineering" Special Interest Group (SIG). The overarching challenge is to create an online space that enhances communication, collaboration, and engagement within the SIG, addressing the limitations of their historical monthly or bimonthly meetings.

Key features and objectives for the new web platform include:

Visibility and Sharing: Increase visibility of the SIG's activities locally, nationally, and globally. Enable the sharing of current research interests among SIG members. Showcase events and SIG-related content to the broader CEEA-ACEG community.

Network Mapping and Building: Develop a feature for mapping the network of individuals and their interests within the SIG. Find ways to connect with similar-minded SIGs and build a broader network.

User-Friendly Design a user-friendly platform that can be easily maintained and supported.

Bilingual Support: Ensure the platform supports bilingual communication, reflecting the diversity of the CEEA-ACEG community.

Member-Only Section: Implement a member-only section for exclusive content and discussions within the SIG.

Given these objectives, the technology and programming environment for the web platform will include StoriesOnBoard, Mural, WordPress and GitHub.

Our design approach would follow a Design Thinking methodology with an Agile/Fast Feedback Cycle. This involves iterative design, prototyping, and testing to ensure the platform meets the needs of the SIG members.

Northstar & Carryover customers:

NorthStar (target) customer: Special Interest Group (SIG) from Canadian Engineering Education Association (CEEA) specifically focused on "Humanities in Engineering" Carryover customers: Anybody with same interests like students, teachers, and other researchers.

Project Constraints:

As we have little exposer to WordPress, we need to go through an extensive learning curve for understanding the terminology, navigating the features, and utilizing the plugins/template effectively.
There is regular update release for WordPress but not all plugins are regularly updated by the plugin provider. So, using outdated or incompatible plugins can lead to functionality issues.
As a website grows, managing content volume can become challenging.
